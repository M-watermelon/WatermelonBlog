**My current score is 20,200 points!** 

### Update after publishing this post: 
Clarification: Because I have surpassed 20,000 points I am technically a National Cyber Scholarship Semifinalist. **However, I already qualified because of picoCTF 2022, and the email from picoCTF confirmed it.**
I'm not eligible for the scholarship, but I'm hoping I can still get the badge for semifinalist. 

**Either way, I'm still going for the silver (50,000) and gold badges (100,000 points).**

### Updates
I was really busy today, but I scored a lot yesterday (including after I posted the updates on my blog), so I was able to stay on track.
Also: I finally realized how the scoring system works: the score is determined by the level you are playing, I probably should have read the full rules. **Level x 100 = points.**

### My schedule / current rate
At my current rate, I should get the silver badge by next week:

| Day      | Score (Expected score -> Actual score) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|~~Day 1~~      | 0 -> 200      |
