**My current score is 20,200 points!** 
### Updates
I was really busy today, but I scored a lot yesterday (including after I posted the updates on my blog), so I was able to stay on track.
Also: I finally realized how the scoring system works: the score is determined by the level you are playing, I probably should have read the full rules. **Level x 100 = points.**

### My schedule / current rate
| Day      | Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|~~Day 1~~      | 0 -> 200      |
| ~~Day 2~~      | 5,000  -> 6,500     |
| ~~Day 3~~   | 10,000        |
| ~~Day 4~~      | 15,000 -> ~18,000 approx  |
| ~~Day 5~~   | 20,000  -> 20,200      |
| Day 6      | 25,000       |
| Day 7   | 30,000        |
| Day 8      | 35,000       |
| Day 9   | 40,000        |
| Day 10      | 45,000       |
| Day 11   | 50,000        |
**I should get the silver award on day eleven.**
