### What I've already done:

---

I changed the dark theme colors to a warmer tint. 

If you look at the [source code to this website](https://github.com/M-watermelon/WatermelonBlog) on github, you'll notice I made a couple commits with pretty similar edit messages - "changing dark mode colors" , "color changes again". That's because I forgot which file determines the final outcome of the website appearance-wise. I was testing changes to CSS files to find out which one will make the permanent color-theme change. There definitely were smarter alternatives I considered, but I was tired. 

For future note: use `_sass/yat/_dark.scss` and `_sass/yat/_layout.scss` to implement theme changes. `_sass/yat/_base.scss` can be used to change the colors of things like links and also add more elaborate styling.

I attempted to change the url of the homepage of the website, to be shorter.

Note, it hasn't worked yet, and I'll continue trying to fix it. I'll add the fix to that here later, but so far I've tried changing it in the github pages settings and changing it in `_config.yml`. Neither worked, so I'll probably just google it or look into republishing the website.

Update: That's pretty much all. I'll keep working on this from time to time, but my main focus is school (which has started again) and BASH scripting.
