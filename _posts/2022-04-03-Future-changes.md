  I'm planning on improvements and changes to this website. There are a couple things that irritate me about the website (hopefully no one has noticed them yet).
  Here's a to do list of the things I plan to either change or fix:
  - [ ] Fix the RSS email subscription link (you can't subscribe for email notification updates about new posts), or delete the option (I don't like email subscriptions).
  - [ ] Fix the website footer links (they are pink, and invisible, I want to change them to be the #84719c (purple) like the other links).
  - [ ] At the top, where all of the links are, I want to get rid of the useless ones (tags and home).
  - [ ] Change the translation page flag images (I just don't like them).
  - [ ] Fix the issue where when the website loads while darkmode is enabled it flashes lightmode (and blinds you).
  - [X] Change the pinkish tint on the home screen banner to a darker blueish color, so that darkmode is easier on eyes. \[Fixed: line 262 of \_site/assets/css/main.css ]
  - [ ] Repository cleanup: get rid of useless files/folders in the github repository that came with the theme
  - [ ] Edit the Favicon cropping, the picture is squished.
  - [ ] Get rid of the hashtag before tag in all posts
  - [ ] Favicon disappears when you navigate away from the homepage
  - [ ] Change the baseurl to just `https://m-watermelon.github.io`, without `/WatermelonBlog/`
  - [ ] (Possibly) Remake the website from scratch, without using the theme, so it is completely original.
  - [X] Add more content!!!
  
  
  Finished tasks look like this:
  - [X] Lorem ipsum
