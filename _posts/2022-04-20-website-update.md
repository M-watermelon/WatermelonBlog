### [My website is hosted on github pages, view it here.](https://m-watermelon.github.io/WatermelonBlog-2.0/) 

### A Change of Plans
I originally intended to recreate my blog site from scratch, so that it could truly be **my** website. However, recently I've been thinking about making a game and browser games in general. Since Cyberstart is still going on, I paused on all of my projects, and I didn't commit many changes (if any) to any of my github repositories. I've been learning JavaScript lately, and found out how I could make a game in JavaScript. So: **I'm gonna convert the website I'm developing into a website with games. I'm going to make a snake game first, and then I might try making flappy bird and then maybe a platformer.** I'm still not sure if I'm going to use python or javascript, but most likey javascript.
