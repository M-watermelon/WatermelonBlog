### What's happened since I last posted

--- 
June: 

I went on vacation for a month, I was pretty burnt out from finals so I mainly relaxed. 

I did some research related to Networking and Linux, but I mainly focused on art and drawing.

July:

I switched my main desktop from Windows to Ubuntu. 

I wanted to do this for a long time because most of the programming and cybersecurity tools I use are on linux. The only thing that was holding me back were audio issues and gaming (Windows-only games). 

* For the gaming part, I eventually figured everything out using WINE and Steam Proton. 

* Audio was even easier to fix than on Windows.

Simply by making this switch, I feel like I've learned a lot of useful things, including how to use the terminal better.

### What I'm working on now


--- 

August: 

Since I'm not on Windows, I can do a lot more customization to make things the way I like it, which gave me a couple of project ideas.

* I've been experimenting with BASH scripting, mainly using it to automate things (like typing terminal commands that have long and annoying file paths, useful for starting up games)

I'm also keeping a computer science journal that has lots of useful notes and reminders for Linux tools.

### What I want to do next

---
Website improvements:
- Making a blog post template document (Ubuntu has a folder for document templates, I want to try using it)
- Finally fixing the home url of this website
- Removing the extra home page link on the top bar
- Add better grouping methods for posts on this website on the home page
---
More linux stuff:
- Continue working with BASH scripting, going beyond using terminal commands and instead learning to use variables, loops, functions, and more. 
- Figure out the issues I've been  experiencing with modding Windows based games.
- Learn more about git, lua,  and onion routing (and networking in general).
