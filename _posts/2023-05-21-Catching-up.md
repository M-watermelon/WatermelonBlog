#### (Still a work in progress!)
### Updates and the like:

I have been very, very busy this year, hence the lack of posts. But I will summarize the main tech and computer science events and accomplishments here:

- Installed a new home button on my Iphone 6s plus
- Attended Harvard Women in Computer Science (WiCS) virtual WiCS Workshop
- Further DWM configs and Arch linux ricing on my thinkpad
- Nintendo 3ds homebrew and developing a jailbreaking hobby
- Nintendo Switch jailbreaking and Yuzu setup
- Formed a cybersecurity and hackathon team
- Competed in PicoCTF 2023 - Team pwned by penguins, 118th place in the US
- Participated in a nearby high school's hackathon
- Competed in Cyberstart 2022-2023 and invited to do scholarship application
- Winning a scholarship for the SANS foundations course
- Switched fron DWM to Hyprland, editing and writing config files 
- Invited to sign up for [USCC Virtual Cyber Camp 2023](https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/cyber-camps) 
- Wrote a couple ctf writeups (I will post them later!)
- AP CSP exam and Hackerrank
- Yearly html/css website speedrun to brush up on front end development and web design skills
- Applied for a biology/chemistry Women In Stem mentorship at College of Dupage 
- Participated in another hackathon hosted by the Girls Who Code club at my school - (see repo here)
- WON beginner's prize for said hackathon, $80 per team, 3 teammates, so roughly $26.6 for me

Not really sure if this is an accomplishment but since the seniors running the computer science club are graduating, a couple club members and I are going to continue the club next year. Hopefully this summer we can get it registered as an official club. 

### Upcoming things:
- [Working through the SANS foundations course](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/foundations/)
- Attending the [USCC Virtual Cyber Camp 2023](https://www.uscyberchallenge.org/cyber-camps)
- Participating in the [WiCys Cyber defense challenge](https://www.wicys.org/benefits/cyber-defense-challenge-made-possible-by-target/)
- Completing the [Harvard CS50 course](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) and getting the certification
- Taking the [GFACT exam](https://www.giac.org/certifications/foundational-cybersecurity-technologies-gfact/)

### Goals:
- Join the science olympiad team - participate in the Cell Biology event
- Join the Girls Who Code Club
- Get accepted for biology or chemistry mentorship at College of Dupage
- Apply for [Lockheed Martin STEM Scholarship](https://lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/stem-education/lm-scholarship-program.html) this fall
- Apply for [Neubauer Phoenix STEM Summer Scholars](https://summer.uchicago.edu/programs/neubauer-phoenix-stem-summer-scholars) next year


**Well, I think that's all for now, I might have missed something, but if I did, its probably not as important as the rest.**



### Cybersecurity and programming competitions
This was an exceptional year for CTFs and hackathons, and its only halfway into 2023. Because of my performance in Cyberstart, I now have a scholarship covering the SANS foundations course and an attempt at the GFACT exam. Additionally, I was invited to participate in the USCC Virtual Cyber Camp this summer, both of which I am definitely going to do over the summer. 

### Ricing arch linux
Thanks to all of the experience I got from ricing my arch linux setup, I am not longer afraid of config files.

My current setup:
- Hyprland on wayland (goodbye xorg), using keybinds inspired by the default dwm ones
- Status bar: Waybar with Catpuccin theme
- GTK theme: Catpuccin Mocha (I believe)
- Terminal: Kitty and XFCE terminall with pywal colors
- Wallpaper daemon: swww
- Launcher: rofi with custom theme 5

I also use:
- ffmpeg to make gif wallpapers
- musikcube as my music player, with the "80s baby" theme
- cava as a music visualizer
- vim with current terminal theme
- code-oss with lilac theme and catpuccin icons

### Jailbreaking devices 
After jaillbreaking my chromebook, I became increasingly interested in jailbreaking other devices. I started researching iphone 6, ipad mini 2, and kindle paperwhite jailbreaks, but these were either shady or outdated. 
However, I did still develop a passion for jailbreaking and enjoy speedrunning them (specifically on nintendo devices). Currently my ~~kill~~ streak is:
- HP x360 Chromebook
- Nintendo 3ds XL
- My sister's Nintendo 3ds XL
- Nintendo switch 

In the future, I will try to jailbreak:
- My printer
- My kindle (if there is a new jailbreak rather than the outdated ones)
- Smart home devices (because of the whole NEST selling out thing going on) and google home stuff
- Maybe my sister's chromebook so I can make a video to go along with my post
But overall I've run out of things that either belong to me or I am allowed to jailbreak, so we'll see. 

### Photos of stuff I did:
Coming soon.
