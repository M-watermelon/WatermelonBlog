### My Progress So Far
As of writing this blog post, I have scored 6000 (\*update:* my score is now 6500) points! I'm having a pretty good time solving these challenges, and I'm glad I joined this competition. My goal is to get into the Gold Badge, which is 100,000 points,so its still a long way to go. You can see the scoring/badge system at the bottom of the [Cyberstart home page](https://www.cyberstartamerica.org/).

### Additionally:
I will get the my official badge soon:

I'm going to post it on this website once I get it.
