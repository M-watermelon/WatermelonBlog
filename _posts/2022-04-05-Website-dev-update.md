Yesterday I started a brand new [repository](https://github.com/M-watermelon/WatermelonBlog-2.0) for this website, remade completely from scratch. Since it was the first day, I didn't get too much done, but it did get [hosted on github pages](https://m-watermelon.github.io/WatermelonBlog-2.0/) without an issue. Today, I added a lot more content:
- The about page and link on homepage
- Page header
- Page footer
- Some consistent fonts
- Favicon
- Lots of centering and positioning
- Colors and CSS styling
- Page banner
  - Banner image
  - Title and subtitle

However, with the page header, banner and footer, I'm having an issue where I can't get rid of the small white space around them, which is really annoying. I have a long list of things to add:
- Archives page
- Tags, Post categories, \[New] post marker
- Post layout
- Consistent site layout that can be applied to pages
- Font sizing
- Make markdown pages for easier use
- And more!

Surprisingly, making a website from scratch hasn't been terribly difficult so far. It just takes time, and you have to add little by little. I had to do some reviewing on HTML and CSS, using my favorite reference [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/ref_html_dtd.asp). I have built a website from scratch with HTML before, but it was in a coding class, and I never published it, so it wasn't much of a website.

I tried a lot of new things this time, its not that impressive, but most of the things I added today, like links, centering, colors, and buttons. I also did a lot of css styling that I never really did before. I learned a lot today, and I doubt I'll forget it for a long time.
