### What it is:

[Uranium Cat<sup>1</sup>](https://m-watermelon.github.io/Uranium-cat/)  is a new [github repository<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/M-watermelon/Uranium-cat) and project made by me. 

It is a chat website made to bypass the URL filters on school wifi. My school has a very strict phone policy this year, and has disabled even Slack due to students using it in class to talk to friends. So, I decided to use this as an oppurtunity for a coding project and make a chat site. 

It is still a work in progress. So far I have used HTML and CSS to build it, but I plan on using PHP, Javascript, and Bootstrap as I learn/experiment.

### Progress so far:

I've:
- Launched github pages for it
- Created basic html foramt and css styles 
- Furnished with a title, body, and footer with the link to the github repository.
- Given it a modern looking makeover
- Built the base for the "chat" box
- Researched best languages/methods for creating chat sites (PHP, Javascript, looked into whether or not python is an option).

### What I need to do next:

Make the chat website into an actual chat website:
- Figure out whether I am going to use PHP or Javascript, and continue researching python alternatives.
- Creating host/client connections, disconnecting
- Write/send messages
- Send button
- Users can choose/enter names
- 'Exit' button
- CSS styling for things like names of different users.

### Long term ideas:

- Keywords for custom ascii symbols (☏, ♫, ♥,  ☺ ,  ☹ , ❇ , ★) (I love these)
- Users can enter a hexadecimal value to choose what color they want their name to be
- Implement security features to prevent unwanted people from joining chats (ie internet trolls, people looking to collect information)
- Support for sending files and images.


.... And so on...

### Why I keep making html websites from scratch + history of these types of projects:


From time to time I review HTML/CSS by making a basic website from scratch, but with a different focus every time. The first time, it was Watermelon Blog 2.0, a remake of this website from scratch, later repurposed for an unfinished browser game project. I considered repurposing the code for Watermelon Blog 2.0 for Uranium Cat, but I felt that the code had been repurposed and mutilated enough. 


**My aim in every programming project / repository of mine is to be able to explain what the significance and function of each line is.**

It is deeply frustrating when there is a line of code that is absolutely essential to my project (ie everything breaks without that one line, especially certain css structure stylings), but I cannot explain what exactly it does. Ultimately, I want to prevent that. After all, if I'm in a job interview, what am I to do when I present a project and the recruiter asks a question about the code I can't answer? 

Additionally, I don't feel that a project is truly my own work, unless I truly made it myself, not some copy paste soup or a step by step reproduction of a tutorial.

### Conflict with tutorials and why Uranium Cat is so important:
Speaking of tutorials, I generally have a hard time with them. Its not because I can't follow them step by step, I can, but when I do, I don't feel like I learned anything. Tutorials make the process exponentially easier, but it becomes *too easy*. I've learned to teach myself using many different resources on the internet, and piecing things together rather than relying on a single source, no matter how good, to provide everything I need. this, along with wanting to feel like I own my work, are the main issues I have with tutorials. But perhaps there is a better way, a proper method to learning from tutorials. **That is what I aim to find discover for myself with Uranium Cat.**

### Progress images:


First launch:

Featured a pastel orange heading and footer, with a light navy background. Unfortunately, I no longer have a record of what it looked like. It looked like an old website.

Sleek and modern redesign:

Chat boxes added and UI design (stage one):
