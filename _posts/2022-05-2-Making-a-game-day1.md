### Details:
- Language: Javascript \[For the game\] with HTML/CSS \[For the website\]
- Type of game: Snake game
- Originality: completely original, made from scratch, no tutorials used -- just occasional research of specific terms
This is going to be a short project I'm going to do. Instead of leaving the code for the second version of my blog site unfinished, I decided to repurpose it for this browser game. I chose to do this project so I can do something simple first, and then move on to the more complex programming projects.
 



### My plan:

1. Set up the basic html formatting and css styles
2. Make the basic canvas and shapes using javascript
3. Add animations and movement using keys
4. Add border/collisions to canvas
5. Polish and add extra features like items/fruits, scores, health
