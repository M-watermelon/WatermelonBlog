[My website is hosted on github pages, view it here.](https://m-watermelon.github.io/WatermelonBlog-2.0/) 

I finally fixed the annoying white space!
The solution: I used this CSS style on the body: `margin:0mm;`, and it worked! Its always one single command that either fixes or breaks everything.
I also created extra whitespace, I wasn't sure how that happened, so I compared the CSS I was editing to the CSS I had posted on github for this project, which hadn't been updated yet and had older code. After deleting a couple lines I had typed (and forgotten about) that were meant to fix the "white space" issue, it worked!
I haven't had much time to work on the website today, but I'm working on it as I'm writing this post.


Fixes and edits done today:
 - Fixed the white space
 Edits done off of github:
 - Removed lines of code I forgot about that were causing problems
 - Removed content wrap styling (it didn't have any effect on the actual website)

This is what I have left to add:
- Move the footer to the bottom of the page
- Archives page
- Tags, Post categories, \[New] post marker
- Post layout
- Consistent site layout that can be applied to pages
- Font sizing
- Make markdown pages for easier use
- And more!
