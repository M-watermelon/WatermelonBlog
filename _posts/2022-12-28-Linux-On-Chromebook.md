## This is a slow work in progress, as I am busy with school work, so don't follow this as a tutorial (yet)


### Disclaimer: This tutorial will COMPLETELY WIPE everything on your chromebook, so beware!

This is a write up on how I installed Kali Linux on my HP chromebook x360 model 14-da0011dx. (Make sure your model is supported for the software we will be installng if you are following this as a tutorial, I will add a link for that later) It currently runs Arch Linux. 

Main steps:
- Enable Developer mode (ctrl-d method) [Powerwashes chromebook]
- Remove Write Protect on Chromebook
- Change bios settings
- Wipe?


draft
Enable developer mode
press and hold Esc + Refresh + power button
screen will go black, then it'll flash a new screen like this
then after that u press ctrl-d
it makes a loud beep
[insert images]
Disable write protect:
unscrew the back of the chromebook, unplug the wire to the battery, screw the back on, press power for 30 seconds while connected to charger

a lot of the chromebooks look different so unplugging the battery may be different than what is pictured here
