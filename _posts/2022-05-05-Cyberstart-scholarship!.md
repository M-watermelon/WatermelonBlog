### Details 
I previously thought that I would not qualify for the scholarship because I wasn't a high school senior or in college, but it seems that information was outdated. I got an email a few days ago from the National Cyber Scholarship Foundation inviting me to apply for the scholarship. The top 1000 highest scorers of Cyberstart will get a $3,000 scholarship to cover the SANS Foundations course and an attempt for the GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT) qualification test. 

> "The GFACT certification validates a practitioner's knowledge of essential foundational cybersecurity concepts. GFACT-certified professionals are familiar with practical skills in computers, technology, and security fundamentals that are needed to kickstart a career in cybersecurity."

GFACT Details:

- One proctored exam
- 2 hour long test
- 75 questions
- 71% score to pass


### What this means

Qualifying for the scholarship would be a great oppurtunity for me, and getting a chance to take the SANS course would be incredible. If I get the scholarship (and even if I don't) I will study as hard as I can to pass the GFACT test. The scholarship and the GFACT test would be a great headstart on my cybersecurity career. So far I have been teaching myself cybersecurity, so a course would be a good boost for me. I'm especially interested in the GFACT exam, because I could be certified in cybersecurity (at least for the foundations) by that exam, and that would be helpful for me in many ways. 

This is only the beginning. I've begun eyeing competitive programming, and I'm going to start using websites like Leetcode and Hacker Rank. I'm also going to do more programming projects, so that I can have knowledge in both cybersecurity and programming. The school year ends in less than a month, so I will have plenty of time for everything over the summer without burning out.
