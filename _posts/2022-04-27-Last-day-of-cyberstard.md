**My current score is 50,400 points!** 

### Updates
I finally reached 50,000 points today, the last day of Cyberstart. I was burning out lately, but I managed to make one final push, and I focused mainly on the moon base, the python programming challenges. I still added some notes to my [cybersecurity guide](https://m-watermelon.github.io/WatermelonBlog/guide/2022/04/02/PicoCTF-Guide-(running).html), and I will be adding more in the future. I mainly learned about python sockets and url requests today.
