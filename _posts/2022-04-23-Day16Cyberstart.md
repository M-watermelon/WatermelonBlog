**My current score is 38,800 points!** 

### Updates
I was supposed to reach my goal of 50,000 points for the silver award in Cyberstart five days ago. Lately, I had been struggling with scoring (especially scoring consistenly) in Cyberstart. This was because I was trying to stay in my comfort zone, rather than coming out and learning something new. This Thursday however, I attempted the ssh challenges, and I learned a lot. I contributed some notes to my [cybersecurity notes](https://m-watermelon.github.io/WatermelonBlog/guide/2022/04/02/PicoCTF-Guide-(running).html) regarding what I have been learning, listed under general.

I finally broke through the 20,000s also this Thursday, and now I'm almost finished with the 30,000s two days later. Cyberstart ends in four days, so I might just be able to get to the 50,000 point threshold and win the silver award. 

### Thoughts about the competition

I was hoping that I could get to the gold award, but I knew that I had started Cyberstart late*. I only found out about it thanks to PicoCTF, so I'm glad that I even became aware of it. 

This Cyberstart competition actually began \*October 27, 2021, and ends April 27 2022. I only just found out how late I was, and I'm grateful that I was able to even begin to approach the silver award, 5 months late, entering the 6th and final one of the competition. All I can think about is how did I not know about this competition sooner.

I'll try to stay notified about upcoming CTFs in the future!
